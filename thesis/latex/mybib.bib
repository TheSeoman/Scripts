The advent of genotyping arrays enabled large-scale genome-wide association studies and methods for examining global transcript levels, which gave rise to the field of ``integrative genetics''. Other omics technologies, such as proteomics and metabolomics, are now often incorporated into the everyday methodology of biological researchers. In this review, we provide an overview of such omics technologies and focus on methods for their integration across multiple omics layers. As compared to studies of a single omics type, multi-omics offers the opportunity to understand the flow of information that underlies disease.",

The STRING database aims to collect and integrate this information, by consolidating known and predicted protein-protein association data for a large number of organisms. The associations in STRING include direct (physical) interactions, as well as indirect (functional) interactions, as long as both are specific and biologically meaningful. Apart from collecting and reassessing available experimental data on protein-protein interactions, and importing known pathways and protein complexes from curated databases, interaction predictions are derived from the following sources: (i) systematic co-expression analysis, (ii) detection of shared selective signals across genomes, (iii) automated text-mining of the scientific literature and (iv) computational transfer of interaction knowledge between organisms based on gene orthology. In the latest version 10.5 of STRING, the biggest changes are concerned with data dissemination: the web frontend has been completely redesigned to reduce dependency on outdated browser technologies, and the database can now also be queried from inside the popular Cytoscape software framework. Further improvements include automated background analysis of user inputs for functional enrichments, and streamlined download options.

abstract={Complete knowledge of all direct and indirect interactions between proteins in a given cell would represent an important milestone towards a comprehensive description of cellular mechanisms and functions. Although this goal is still elusive, considerable progress has been made--particularly for certain model organisms and functional systems. Currently, protein interactions and associations are annotated at various levels of detail in online resources, ranging from raw data repositories to highly formalized pathway databases. For many applications, a global view of all the available interaction data is desirable, including lower-quality data and/or computational predictions. The STRING database (http://string-db.org/) aims to provide such a global perspective for as many organisms as feasible. Known and predicted associations are scored and integrated, resulting in comprehensive protein networks covering >1100 organisms. Here, we describe the update to version 9.1 of STRING, introducing several improvements: (i) we extend the automated mining of scientific texts for interaction information, to now also include full-text articles; (ii) we entirely re-designed the algorithm for transferring interactions from one model organism to the other; and (iii) we provide users with statistical information on any functional enrichment observed in their networks.},

abstract = {Summary This paper investigates the roles of partial correlation and conditional correlation as measures of the conditional independence of two random variables. It first establishes a sufficient condition for the coincidence of the partial correlation with the conditional correlation. The condition is satisfied not only for multivariate normal but also for elliptical, multivariate hypergeometric, multivariate negative hypergeometric, multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. Such families of distributions are characterized by a semigroup property as a parametric family of distributions. A necessary and sufficient condition for the coincidence of the partial covariance with the conditional covariance is also derived. However, a known family of multivariate distributions which satisfies this condition cannot be found, except for the multivariate normal. The paper also shows that conditional independence has no close ties with zero partial correlation except in the case of the multivariate normal distribution; it has rather close ties to the zero conditional correlation. It shows that the equivalence between zero conditional covariance and conditional independence for normal variables is retained by any monotone transformation of each variable. The results suggest that care must be taken when using such correlations as measures of conditional independence unless the joint distribution is known to be normal. Otherwise a new concept of conditional independence may need to be introduced in place of conditional independence through zero conditional correlation or other statistics.}

ABSTRACT={The genomes of large multicellular eukaryotes are mostly comprised of non-protein coding DNA. Although there has been much agreement that a small fraction of these genomes has important biological functions, there has been much debate as to whether the rest contributes to development and/or homeostasis. Much of the speculation has centered on the genomic regions that are transcribed into RNA at some low level. Unfortunately these RNAs have been arbitrarily assigned various names, such as “intergenic RNA”, “long non-coding RNAs” etc., which have led to some confusion in the field. Many researchers believe that these transcripts represent a vast, unchartered world of functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), simply because they exist. However, there are reasons to question this Panglossian view because it ignores our current understanding of how evolution shapes eukaryotic genomes and how the gene expression machinery works in eukaryotic cells. Although there are undoubtedly many more functional ncRNAs yet to be discovered and characterized, it is also likely that many of these transcripts are simply junk. Here we discuss how to determine whether any given ncRNA has a function. Importantly, we advocate that in the absence of any such data, the appropriate null hypothesis is that the RNA in question is junk.}

Although the distribution has received considerable attention, posterior inference has proven computationally challenging, in part owing to the lack of a direct sampler. In this note, we rectify this situation. The existence of a direct sampler offers a host of new possibilities for the use of G‐Wishart variates. We discuss one such development by outlining a new transdimensional model search algorithm—which we term double reversible jump—that leverages this sampler to avoid normalizing constant calculation when comparing graphical models. We conclude with two short studies meant to investigate our algorithm's validity. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd}

	abstract = {Chromatin modifiers add chemical groups to histones, the proteins that package DNA. These modifications are central to cellular development, and mutations in their molecular machinery are linked to a variety of human diseases. Piunti and Shilatifard review the balance between the prototypic chromatin modifiers Polycomb and COMPASS complexes and their role in gene regulation and normal development. Although originally identified as indispensible regulators of fruit fly development, related roles have been identified in other organisms. Furthermore, mutations in human homologs have been implicated in various cancers. As such, these complexes may serve as effective targets for epigenetic therapies.Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad9780BACKGROUNDMulticellular organisms depend on the precise orchestration of gene expression to direct embryonic development and to maintain tissue homeostasis through their life spans. Exactly how such cell type{\textendash}specific patterns of gene expression are established, maintained, and passed on to the next generation is one of the most fundamental questions of biology. Eukaryotes package their DNA into nucleosomes to form chromatin fibers. Chromatin plays a central role in regulating accessibility to DNA in many different DNA templated processes, including machineries that transcribe DNA into RNA, i.e., transcription. Transcriptional control through sequence-specific DNA binding factors (transcription factors) is well established; however, proteins that change chromatin structure (chromatin modifiers and remodelers) provide an additional layer of regulation and are considered major epigenetic determinants of cell identity and function. Among the numerous chromatin modifiers, the members of the Polycomb group (PcG) and the Trithorax group (TrxG) of proteins, in particular, have been scrutinized genetically and biochemically for decades. However, new and unexpected functions for these complexes are constantly emerging because of the intense interest in the critical role these proteins play in maintaining a balanced state of gene expression.ADVANCESIn the classical view, PcG and TrxG proteins regulate the repressed and activated states of gene expression, respectively. Both PcG and TrxG are organized in multiprotein complexes, which include the Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2, respectively), and the complex of proteins associated with Set1 (COMPASS) family. Polycomb and COMPASS families are well known for their opposing roles in balancing gene expression, a phenomenon initially characterized using classical Drosophila melanogaster genetic approaches at a time when their biochemical functions were still unknown. Later studies demonstrated that Polycomb and COMPASS complexes have enzymatic activities modifying different sites on a common target, the nucleosome. Nucleosomes can be posttranslationally modified in a variety of ways, many of which strongly correlate with different states of gene expression. Through their ability to regulate gene expression, several components of both the Polycomb and COMPASS complexes are involved in a plethora of crucial biological processes ranging from the regulation of embryonic development to widespread involvement in neoplastic pathogenesis. OUTLOOKRecent genome-wide studies have demonstrated that a large number of the components of the Polycomb and COMPASS families are often mutated in different forms of cancer. Some mutations result in gene deletion or early termination, such as loss-of-function (LOF) mutations, whereas gain-of-function (GOF) mutations increase or change their normal activities. Although it cannot be excluded that some of those are passenger rather than driver mutations, they suggest a relevant function of these proteins in tumorigenesis. Moreover, animal models have provided convincing evidence supporting a role for these complexes in tumor progression. However, even after decades of study, how Polycomb and COMPASS control normal or aberrant gene regulatory networks is not fully understood yet. From the perspective of their catalytic activities, the degree to which catalytic versus noncatalytic functions contribute to their roles in development and cancer has just begun to emerge. Concurrently, the possibility that PcG and TrxG enzymatic activities modify non-nucleosome substrates remains a fascinating, although largely unexplored, hypothesis. Ongoing efforts to decipher how mutations affecting members of these complexes disturb transcriptional balances and promote oncogenesis could provide critically needed new strategies for cancer therapeutics.The balanced state of gene expression. The scale symbolizes the transcriptional status of a gene. Each dish contains a nucleosome that is either lysine 4 trimethylated (green light) or lysine 27 tri-methylated (red light) on histone H3 (one tail is depicted for simplicity). These two histone marks strongly correlate, respectively, with transcriptional activation induced by COMPASS and transcriptional repression induced by PcG. [Figure by Mark Miller. Nucleosomes are adapted from a custom model from 3D Molecular Designs]Epigenetic regulation of gene expression in metazoans is central for establishing cellular diversity, and its deregulation can result in pathological conditions. Although transcription factors are essential for implementing gene expression programs, they do not function in isolation and require the recruitment of various chromatin-modifying and -remodeling machineries. A classic example of developmental chromatin regulation is the balanced activities of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins within the PRC1 and PRC2 complexes, and the Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins within the COMPASS family, which are highly mutated in a large number of human diseases. In this review, we will discuss the latest findings regarding the properties of the PcG and COMPASS families and the insight they provide into the epigenetic control of transcription under physiological and pathological settings.},

Most, perhaps all, CGIs are sites of transcription initiation, including thousands that are remote from currently annotated promoters. Shared DNA sequence features adapt CGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state. Silencing of CGI promoters is achieved through dense CpG methylation or polycomb recruitment, again using their distinctive DNA sequence composition. CGIs are therefore generically equipped to influence local chromatin structure and simplify regulation of gene activity.},

The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional \~{}12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA.

Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

abstract = { AbstractThe capacity to integrate into the chromosomal DNA of germ-line cells has endowed retroviruses with the potential to be vertically transmitted from generation to generation and eventually become fixed in the genomes of the entire population. This has been independently accomplished by several ancient retroviruses that invaded the genomes of our early and more recent primate and hominoid ancestors. Some of the inherited elements then proliferated in the genome, resulting in a number of lineages with complex phylogenetic patterns. Although the vast majority of chromosomally integrated retroelements have suffered inactivating mutations and deletions, a significant impact on various aspects of human biology has been recently revealed and evidence for the present activity of at least one human endogenous retrovirus family continues to accumulate. }

journal={BMC Syst Biol},
year={2011},

publisher={BioMed Central},
volume={5},
pages={21-21},
abstract={BACKGROUND: With the advent of high-throughput targeted metabolic profiling techniques, the question of how to interpret and analyze the resulting vast amount of data becomes more and more important. In this work we address the reconstruction of metabolic reactions from cross-sectional metabolomics data, that is without the requirement for time-resolved measurements or specific system perturbations. Previous studies in this area mainly focused on Pearson correlation coefficients, which however are generally incapable of distinguishing between direct and indirect metabolic interactions. RESULTS: In our new approach we propose the application of a Gaussian graphical model (GGM), an undirected probabilistic graphical model estimating the conditional dependence between variables. GGMs are based on partial correlation coefficients, that is pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients conditioned against the correlation with all other metabolites. We first demonstrate the general validity of the method and its advantages over regular correlation networks with computer-simulated reaction systems. Then we estimate a GGM on data from a large human population cohort, covering 1020 fasting blood serum samples with 151 quantified metabolites. The GGM is much sparser than the correlation network, shows a modular structure with respect to metabolite classes, and is stable to the choice of samples in the data set. On the example of human fatty acid metabolism, we demonstrate for the first time that high partial correlation coefficients generally correspond to known metabolic reactions. This feature is evaluated both manually by investigating specific pairs of high-scoring metabolites, and then systematically on a literature-curated model of fatty acid synthesis and degradation. Our method detects many known reactions along with possibly novel pathway interactions, representing candidates for further experimental examination. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrate strong signatures of intracellular pathways in blood serum data, and provide a valuable tool for the unbiased reconstruction of metabolic reactions from large-scale metabolomics data sets.},

ABSTRACT={DNA methylation levels vary markedly by cell-type makeup of a sample.  Understanding these differences and estimating the cell-type makeup of a sample is an important aspect of studying DNA methylation.  DNA from leukocytes in whole blood is simple to obtain and pervasive in research.  However, leukocytes contain many distinct cell types and subtypes.  We propose a two-stage model that estimates the proportions of 6 main cell types in whole blood (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, B cells, granulocytes, and natural killer cells) as well as subtypes of T and B cells.  Unlike previous methods that only estimate overall proportions of CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cells, and B cells, our model is able to estimate proportions of naïve, memory, and regulatory CD4+ T cells as well as naïve and memory CD8+ T cells and naïve and memory B cells.  Using real and simulated data, we are able to demonstrate that our model is able to reliably estimate proportions of these cell types and subtypes.  In studies with DNA methylation data from Illumina’s HumanMethylation450k arrays, our estimates will be useful both for testing for associations of cell type and subtype composition with phenotypes of interest as well as for adjustment purposes to prevent confounding in epigenetic association studies.  Additionally, our method can be easily adapted for use with whole genome bisulfite sequencing data or any other genome-wide methylation data platform.}

    abstract = {Author Summary Large association studies have proven to be effective tools for identifying parts of the genome that influence disease risk and other heritable traits. So-called “genotype imputation” methods form a cornerstone of modern association studies: by extrapolating genetic correlations from a densely characterized reference panel to a sparsely typed study sample, such methods can estimate unobserved genotypes with high accuracy, thereby increasing the chances of finding true associations. To date, most genome-wide imputation analyses have used reference data from the International HapMap Project. While this strategy has been successful, association studies in the near future will also have access to additional reference information, such as control sets genotyped on multiple SNP chips and dense genome-wide haplotypes from the 1,000 Genomes Project. These new reference panels should improve the quality and scope of imputation, but they also present new methodological challenges. We describe a genotype imputation method, IMPUTE version 2, that is designed to address these challenges in next-generation association studies. We show that our method can use a reference panel containing thousands of chromosomes to attain higher accuracy than is possible with the HapMap alone, and that our approach is more accurate than competing methods on both current and next-generation datasets. We also highlight the modeling issues that arise in imputation datasets.},

	abstract = {When the DNA bases cytosine and guanine are next to each other, a methyl group is generally added to the pyrimidine, generating a mCpG dinucleotide. This modification alters DNA structure but can also affect function by inhibiting transcription factor (TF) binding. Yin et al. systematically analyzed the effect of CpG methylation on the binding of 542 human TFs (see the Perspective by Hughes and Lambert). In addition to inhibiting binding of some TFs, they found that mCpGs can promote binding of others, particularly TFs involved in development, such as homeodomain proteins.Science, this issue p. eaaj2239; see also p. 489INTRODUCTIONNearly all cells in the human body share the same primary genome sequence consisting of four nucleotide bases. One of the bases, cytosine, is commonly modified by methylation of its 5 position in CpG dinucleotides (mCpG). Most CpG dinucleotides in the human genome are methylated, but the level of CpG methylation varies with genetic location (promoter versus gene body), whether genes are active versus silenced, and cell type. Research has shown that the maintenance of a particular cellular state after cell division is dependent on faithful transmission of methylated CpGs, as well as inheritance of the mother cells{\textquoteright} repertoire of transcription factors by the daughter cells. These two mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance are linked to each other; the binding of transcription factors can be affected by cytosine methylation, and cytosine methylation can, in turn, be added or removed by proteins that associate with transcription factors.RATIONALEThe genetic and epigenetic language, which imparts when and where genes are expressed, is understood at a conceptual level. However, a more detailed understanding is needed of the genomic regulatory mechanism by which methylated cytosines affect transcription factor binding. Because cytosine methylation changes DNA structure, it has the potential to affect binding of all transcription factors. However, a systematic analysis of binding of a large collection of transcription factors to all possible DNA sequences has not previously been conducted.RESULTSTo globally characterize the effect of cytosine methylation on transcription factor binding, we systematically analyzed binding specificities of full-length transcription factors and extended DNA binding domains to unmethylated and CpG-methylated DNA by using methylation-sensitive SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment). We evaluated binding of 542 transcription factors and identified a large number of previously uncharacterized transcription factor recognition motifs. Binding of most major classes of transcription factors, including bHLH, bZIP, and ETS, was inhibited by mCpG. In contrast, transcription factors such as homeodomain, POU, and NFAT proteins preferred to bind methylated DNA. This class of binding was enriched in factors with central roles in embryonic and organismal development. The observed binding preferences were validated using several orthogonal methods, including bisulfite-SELEX and protein-binding microarrays. In addition, the preference of the pluripotency factor OCT4 to bind to a mCpG-containing motif was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells with low or high levels of CpG methylation (due to deficiency in all enzymes that methylate cytosines or contribute to their removal, respectively). Crystal structure analysis of the homeodomain proteins HOXB13, CDX1, CDX2, and LHX4 revealed three key residues that contribute to the preference of this developmentally important family of transcription factors for mCpG. The preference for binding to mCpG was due to direct hydrophobic interactions with the 5-methyl group of methylcytosine. In contrast, inhibition of binding of other transcription factors to methylated sequences was found to be caused by steric hindrance.CONCLUSIONOur work constitutes a global analysis of the effect of cytosine methylation on DNA binding specificities of human transcription factors. CpG methylation can influence binding of most transcription factors to DNA{\textemdash}in some cases negatively and in others positively. Our finding that many developmentally important transcription factors prefer to bind to mCpG sites can inform future analyses of the role of DNA methylation on cell differentiation, chromatin reprogramming, and transcriptional regulation.Systematic analysis of the impact of CpG methylation on transcription factor binding.The bottom left panel shows the fraction of transcription factors that prefer methylated (orange) or unmethylated (teal) CpG sites, are affected in multiple ways (yellow), are not affected (green), or do not have a CpG in their motifs (gray), as determined by methylation-sensitive SELEX (top left). The structure and logos on the right highlight how HOXB13 recognizes mCpG (blue shading indicates a CpG affected by methylation).The majority of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome are methylated at cytosine bases. However, active gene regulatory elements are generally hypomethylated relative to their flanking regions, and the binding of some transcription factors (TFs) is diminished by methylation of their target sequences. By analysis of 542 human TFs with methylation-sensitive SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), we found that there are also many TFs that prefer CpG-methylated sequences. Most of these are in the extended homeodomain family. Structural analysis showed that homeodomain specificity for methylcytosine depends on direct hydrophobic interactions with the methylcytosine 5-methyl group. This study provides a systematic examination of the effect of an epigenetic DNA modification on human TF binding specificity and reveals that many developmentally important proteins display preference for mCpG-containing sequences.},

abstract={Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) has become the dominant technique for mapping transcription factor (TF) binding regions genome-wide. We performed an integrative analysis centered around 457 ChIP-seq data sets on 119 human TFs generated by the ENCODE Consortium. We identified highly enriched sequence motifs in most data sets, revealing new motifs and validating known ones. The motif sites (TF binding sites) are highly conserved evolutionarily and show distinct footprints upon DNase I digestion. We frequently detected secondary motifs in addition to the canonical motifs of the TFs, indicating tethered binding and cobinding between multiple TFs. We observed significant position and orientation preferences between many cobinding TFs. Genes specifically expressed in a cell line are often associated with a greater occurrence of nearby TF binding in that cell line. We observed cell-line-specific secondary motifs that mediate the binding of the histone deacetylase HDAC2 and the enhancer-binding protein EP300. TF binding sites are located in GC-rich, nucleosome-depleted, and DNase I sensitive regions, flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes, and many of these features show cell type specificity. The GC-richness may be beneficial for regulating TF binding because, when unoccupied by a TF, these regions are occupied by nucleosomes in vivo. We present the results of our analysis in a TF-centric web repository Factorbook (http://factorbook.org) and will continually update this repository as more ENCODE data are generated.},

abstract={The TRANSFAC(?) database on transcription factors, their binding sites, nucleotide distribution matrices and regulated genes as well as the complementing database TRANSCompel(?) on composite elements have been further enhanced on various levels. A new web interface with different search options and integrated versions of Match(tm) and Patch(tm) provides increased functionality for TRANSFAC(?). The list of databases which are linked to the common GENE table of TRANSFAC(?) and TRANSCompel(?) has been extended by: Ensembl, UniGene, EntrezGene, HumanPSD(tm) and TRANSPRO(tm). Standard gene names from HGNC, MGI and RGD, are included for human, mouse and rat genes, respectively. With the help of InterProScan, Pfam, SMART and PROSITE domains are assigned automatically to the protein sequences of the transcription factors. TRANSCompel(?) contains now, in addition to the COMPEL table, a separate table for detailed information on the experimental EVIDENCE on which the composite elements are based. Finally, for TRANSFAC(?), in respect of data growth, in particular the gain of Drosophila transcription factor binding sites (by courtesy of the Drosophila DNase I footprint database) and of Arabidopsis factors (by courtesy of DATF, Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors) has to be stressed. The here described public releases, TRANSFAC(?) 7.0 and TRANSCompel(?) 7.0, are accessible under .},

 abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

pages={23},
abstract={The prevailing views as to the form, function, and regulation of genomic methylation patterns have their origin many years in the past, at a time when the structure of the mammalian genome was only dimly perceived, when the number of protein-encoding mammalian genes was believed to be at least five times greater than the actual number, and when it was not understood that only {\textasciitilde}10\% of the genome is under selective pressure and likely to have biological function. We use more recent findings from genome biology and whole-genome methylation profiling to provide a reappraisal of the shape of genomic methylation patterns and the nature of the changes that they undergo during gametogenesis and early development. We observe that the sequences that undergo deep changes in methylation status during early development are largely sequences without regulatory function. We also discuss recent findings that begin to explain the remarkable fidelity of maintenance methylation. Rather than a general overview of DNA methylation in mammals (which has been the subject of many reviews), we present a new analysis of the distribution of methylated CpG dinucleotides across the multiple sequence compartments that make up the mammalian genome, and we offer an updated interpretation of the nature of the changes in methylation patterns that occur in germ cells and early embryos. We discuss the cues that might designate specific sequences for demethylation or de novo methylation during development, and we summarize recent findings on mechanisms that maintain methylation patterns in mammalian genomes. We also describe the several human disorders, each very different from the other, that are caused by mutations in DNA methyltransferase genes.},

    abstract = {Background We aimed to assess whether whole blood expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with effects in cis and trans are robust and can be used to identify regulatory pathways affecting disease susceptibility.  Materials and Methods We performed whole-genome eQTL analyses in 890 participants of the KORA F4 study and in two independent replication samples (SHIP-TREND, N = 976 and EGCUT, N = 842) using linear regression models and Bonferroni correction.  Results In the KORA F4 study, 4,116 cis-eQTLs (defined as SNP-probe pairs where the SNP is located within a 500 kb window around the transcription unit) and 94 trans-eQTLs reached genome-wide significance and overall 91% (92% of cis-, 84% of trans-eQTLs) were confirmed in at least one of the two replication studies. Different study designs including distinct laboratory reagents (PAXgene™ vs. Tempus™ tubes) did not affect reproducibility (separate overall replication overlap: 78% and 82%). Immune response pathways were enriched in cis- and trans-eQTLs and significant cis-eQTLs were partly coexistent in other tissues (cross-tissue similarity 40–70%). Furthermore, four chromosomal regions displayed simultaneous impact on multiple gene expression levels in trans, and 746 eQTL-SNPs have been previously reported to have clinical relevance. We demonstrated cross-associations between eQTL-SNPs, gene expression levels in trans, and clinical phenotypes as well as a link between eQTLs and human metabolic traits via modification of gene regulation in cis.  Conclusions Our data suggest that whole blood is a robust tissue for eQTL analysis and may be used both for biomarker studies and to enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gene-disease associations.},

abstract={A considerable portion of vertebrate genomes are made up of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). While aberrant or uncontrolled ERV expression has been perceived as a potential cause of disease, there is mounting evidence that some ERVs have become integral components of normal host development and physiology. Here, we revisit the longstanding concept that some of the gene products encoded by ERVs and other endogenous viral elements may offer to the host protection against viral infection. Notably, proteins produced from envelope (env) genes have been shown to act as restriction factors against related exogenous retroviruses in chickens, sheep, mice, and cats. Based on the proposed mode of restriction and the domain architecture of known antiretroviral env, we argue that many more env gene-derived restriction factors await discovery in vertebrate genomes, including the human genome.},

abstract = {Endogenous retroviral sequences are spread throughout the genome of all humans, and make up about 8\% of the genome. Despite their prevalence, the function of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) in humans is largely unknown. In this review we focus on the brain, and evaluate studies in animal models that address mechanisms of endogenous retrovirus activation in the brain and central nervous system (CNS). One such study in mice found that TRIM28, a protein critical for mouse early development, regulates transcription and silencing of endogenous retroviruses in neural progenitor cells. Another intriguing finding in human brain cells and mouse models was that endogenous retrovirus HERV‐K appears to be protective against neurotoxins. We also report on studies that associate HERVs with human diseases of the brain and CNS. There is little doubt of an association between HERVs and a number of CNS diseases. However, a cause and effect relationship between HERVs and these diseases has not yet been established.}
