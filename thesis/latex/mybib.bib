ABSTRACT={DNA methylation levels vary markedly by cell-type makeup of a sample.  Understanding these differences and estimating the cell-type makeup of a sample is an important aspect of studying DNA methylation.  DNA from leukocytes in whole blood is simple to obtain and pervasive in research.  However, leukocytes contain many distinct cell types and subtypes.  We propose a two-stage model that estimates the proportions of 6 main cell types in whole blood (CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, B cells, granulocytes, and natural killer cells) as well as subtypes of T and B cells.  Unlike previous methods that only estimate overall proportions of CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cells, and B cells, our model is able to estimate proportions of naïve, memory, and regulatory CD4+ T cells as well as naïve and memory CD8+ T cells and naïve and memory B cells.  Using real and simulated data, we are able to demonstrate that our model is able to reliably estimate proportions of these cell types and subtypes.  In studies with DNA methylation data from Illumina’s HumanMethylation450k arrays, our estimates will be useful both for testing for associations of cell type and subtype composition with phenotypes of interest as well as for adjustment purposes to prevent confounding in epigenetic association studies.  Additionally, our method can be easily adapted for use with whole genome bisulfite sequencing data or any other genome-wide methylation data platform.}

    abstract = {Author Summary Large association studies have proven to be effective tools for identifying parts of the genome that influence disease risk and other heritable traits. So-called “genotype imputation” methods form a cornerstone of modern association studies: by extrapolating genetic correlations from a densely characterized reference panel to a sparsely typed study sample, such methods can estimate unobserved genotypes with high accuracy, thereby increasing the chances of finding true associations. To date, most genome-wide imputation analyses have used reference data from the International HapMap Project. While this strategy has been successful, association studies in the near future will also have access to additional reference information, such as control sets genotyped on multiple SNP chips and dense genome-wide haplotypes from the 1,000 Genomes Project. These new reference panels should improve the quality and scope of imputation, but they also present new methodological challenges. We describe a genotype imputation method, IMPUTE version 2, that is designed to address these challenges in next-generation association studies. We show that our method can use a reference panel containing thousands of chromosomes to attain higher accuracy than is possible with the HapMap alone, and that our approach is more accurate than competing methods on both current and next-generation datasets. We also highlight the modeling issues that arise in imputation datasets.},

	abstract = {When the DNA bases cytosine and guanine are next to each other, a methyl group is generally added to the pyrimidine, generating a mCpG dinucleotide. This modification alters DNA structure but can also affect function by inhibiting transcription factor (TF) binding. Yin et al. systematically analyzed the effect of CpG methylation on the binding of 542 human TFs (see the Perspective by Hughes and Lambert). In addition to inhibiting binding of some TFs, they found that mCpGs can promote binding of others, particularly TFs involved in development, such as homeodomain proteins.Science, this issue p. eaaj2239; see also p. 489INTRODUCTIONNearly all cells in the human body share the same primary genome sequence consisting of four nucleotide bases. One of the bases, cytosine, is commonly modified by methylation of its 5 position in CpG dinucleotides (mCpG). Most CpG dinucleotides in the human genome are methylated, but the level of CpG methylation varies with genetic location (promoter versus gene body), whether genes are active versus silenced, and cell type. Research has shown that the maintenance of a particular cellular state after cell division is dependent on faithful transmission of methylated CpGs, as well as inheritance of the mother cells{\textquoteright} repertoire of transcription factors by the daughter cells. These two mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance are linked to each other; the binding of transcription factors can be affected by cytosine methylation, and cytosine methylation can, in turn, be added or removed by proteins that associate with transcription factors.RATIONALEThe genetic and epigenetic language, which imparts when and where genes are expressed, is understood at a conceptual level. However, a more detailed understanding is needed of the genomic regulatory mechanism by which methylated cytosines affect transcription factor binding. Because cytosine methylation changes DNA structure, it has the potential to affect binding of all transcription factors. However, a systematic analysis of binding of a large collection of transcription factors to all possible DNA sequences has not previously been conducted.RESULTSTo globally characterize the effect of cytosine methylation on transcription factor binding, we systematically analyzed binding specificities of full-length transcription factors and extended DNA binding domains to unmethylated and CpG-methylated DNA by using methylation-sensitive SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment). We evaluated binding of 542 transcription factors and identified a large number of previously uncharacterized transcription factor recognition motifs. Binding of most major classes of transcription factors, including bHLH, bZIP, and ETS, was inhibited by mCpG. In contrast, transcription factors such as homeodomain, POU, and NFAT proteins preferred to bind methylated DNA. This class of binding was enriched in factors with central roles in embryonic and organismal development. The observed binding preferences were validated using several orthogonal methods, including bisulfite-SELEX and protein-binding microarrays. In addition, the preference of the pluripotency factor OCT4 to bind to a mCpG-containing motif was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells with low or high levels of CpG methylation (due to deficiency in all enzymes that methylate cytosines or contribute to their removal, respectively). Crystal structure analysis of the homeodomain proteins HOXB13, CDX1, CDX2, and LHX4 revealed three key residues that contribute to the preference of this developmentally important family of transcription factors for mCpG. The preference for binding to mCpG was due to direct hydrophobic interactions with the 5-methyl group of methylcytosine. In contrast, inhibition of binding of other transcription factors to methylated sequences was found to be caused by steric hindrance.CONCLUSIONOur work constitutes a global analysis of the effect of cytosine methylation on DNA binding specificities of human transcription factors. CpG methylation can influence binding of most transcription factors to DNA{\textemdash}in some cases negatively and in others positively. Our finding that many developmentally important transcription factors prefer to bind to mCpG sites can inform future analyses of the role of DNA methylation on cell differentiation, chromatin reprogramming, and transcriptional regulation.Systematic analysis of the impact of CpG methylation on transcription factor binding.The bottom left panel shows the fraction of transcription factors that prefer methylated (orange) or unmethylated (teal) CpG sites, are affected in multiple ways (yellow), are not affected (green), or do not have a CpG in their motifs (gray), as determined by methylation-sensitive SELEX (top left). The structure and logos on the right highlight how HOXB13 recognizes mCpG (blue shading indicates a CpG affected by methylation).The majority of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome are methylated at cytosine bases. However, active gene regulatory elements are generally hypomethylated relative to their flanking regions, and the binding of some transcription factors (TFs) is diminished by methylation of their target sequences. By analysis of 542 human TFs with methylation-sensitive SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), we found that there are also many TFs that prefer CpG-methylated sequences. Most of these are in the extended homeodomain family. Structural analysis showed that homeodomain specificity for methylcytosine depends on direct hydrophobic interactions with the methylcytosine 5-methyl group. This study provides a systematic examination of the effect of an epigenetic DNA modification on human TF binding specificity and reveals that many developmentally important proteins display preference for mCpG-containing sequences.},

abstract={Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) has become the dominant technique for mapping transcription factor (TF) binding regions genome-wide. We performed an integrative analysis centered around 457 ChIP-seq data sets on 119 human TFs generated by the ENCODE Consortium. We identified highly enriched sequence motifs in most data sets, revealing new motifs and validating known ones. The motif sites (TF binding sites) are highly conserved evolutionarily and show distinct footprints upon DNase I digestion. We frequently detected secondary motifs in addition to the canonical motifs of the TFs, indicating tethered binding and cobinding between multiple TFs. We observed significant position and orientation preferences between many cobinding TFs. Genes specifically expressed in a cell line are often associated with a greater occurrence of nearby TF binding in that cell line. We observed cell-line-specific secondary motifs that mediate the binding of the histone deacetylase HDAC2 and the enhancer-binding protein EP300. TF binding sites are located in GC-rich, nucleosome-depleted, and DNase I sensitive regions, flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes, and many of these features show cell type specificity. The GC-richness may be beneficial for regulating TF binding because, when unoccupied by a TF, these regions are occupied by nucleosomes in vivo. We present the results of our analysis in a TF-centric web repository Factorbook (http://factorbook.org) and will continually update this repository as more ENCODE data are generated.},

TRANSCompel(?) contains now, in addition to the COMPEL table, a separate table for detailed information on the experimental EVIDENCE on which the composite elements are based. Finally, for TRANSFAC(?), in respect of data growth, in particular the gain of Drosophila transcription factor binding sites (by courtesy of the Drosophila DNase I footprint database) and of Arabidopsis factors (by courtesy of DATF, Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors) has to be stressed.

 abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract={The prevailing views as to the form, function, and regulation of genomic methylation patterns have their origin many years in the past, at a time when the structure of the mammalian genome was only dimly perceived, when the number of protein-encoding mammalian genes was believed to be at least five times greater than the actual number, and when it was not understood that only {\textasciitilde}10\% of the genome is under selective pressure and likely to have biological function. We use more recent findings from genome biology and whole-genome methylation profiling to provide a reappraisal of the shape of genomic methylation patterns and the nature of the changes that they undergo during gametogenesis and early development. We observe that the sequences that undergo deep changes in methylation status during early development are largely sequences without regulatory function. We also discuss recent findings that begin to explain the remarkable fidelity of maintenance methylation. Rather than a general overview of DNA methylation in mammals (which has been the subject of many reviews), we present a new analysis of the distribution of methylated CpG dinucleotides across the multiple sequence compartments that make up the mammalian genome, and we offer an updated interpretation of the nature of the changes in methylation patterns that occur in germ cells and early embryos. We discuss the cues that might designate specific sequences for demethylation or de novo methylation during development, and we summarize recent findings on mechanisms that maintain methylation patterns in mammalian genomes. We also describe the several human disorders, each very different from the other, that are caused by mutations in DNA methyltransferase genes.},
